My first OpenClassrooms project "BOOKI", an "AirBnb" type website. 

I had a Figma model to rely on, and the goal was to be as faithful to it as possible.

Could not rely on SCSS or other preprocessors, only CSS was specifically asked. 

Mostly Flexbox was used, as it was also amongst the specified requirements.

I was asked to make this website responsive, for tablets and phones, and functional to a min-width limit of 320px.
